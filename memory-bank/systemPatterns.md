# System Patterns: Kafra

## System Architecture

- Monolithic backend application.
- Uses Spring Boot framework.

## Key Technical Decisions

- Java as the primary programming language.
- Maven for dependency management and build automation.
- Data persistence likely handled by Spring Data JPA with a relational database (inferred from `Repository` interfaces).

## Design Patterns in Use

- Repository Pattern for data access (`*Repository.java`).
- Command Pattern for handling user commands (`Command.java`, `*Command.java`, `CommandManager.java`). `CommandManagerImpl` is responsible for redirecting commands to their respective implementations.
- Event-Driven Architecture for certain processes (inferred from `*Event.java` and `*EventHandler.java`).

## Component Relationships

- Commands interact with Services.
- Services interact with Repositories for data access.
- Events are processed by Handlers.

## Critical Implementation Paths

- Command processing flow: User input -> CommandManager -> Command -> Service -> Repository.
- Data persistence flow: Service/Command -> Repository -> Database.
- Event handling flow: Event triggered -> EventHandler -> Service/Repository.
