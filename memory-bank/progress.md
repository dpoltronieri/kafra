# Progress: Kafra

## What Works

- Initial Memory Bank structure is being established.
- Basic understanding of project purpose and structure gained from existing files and file listing.

## What's Left to Build

- The core application logic and features described in `productContext.md` and `projectbrief.md`.
- Full implementation of data persistence, command handling, and event processing.
- Any additional features or integrations.

## Current Status

- Memory Bank setup is in progress.
- Project code exists but its current functional status is unknown without further investigation (e.g., building and running the application).

## Known Issues

- None identified yet, as the application has not been built or run in this session.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The initial decision to use Java and Spring Boot is evident.
- The use of a Memory Bank for documentation is a key project decision for my operation.

## Recent Progress

- Resolved `UnsatisfiedDependencyException` by adding `spring.ai.gemini_api_key` to `application.properties`.
- Resolved `IllegalArgumentException: Token may not be empty` by adding `spring.jda.token` to `application.properties`.
- Maven build now completes successfully.
