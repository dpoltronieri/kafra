# Product Context: Kafra

## Purpose

Kafra is designed to serve as a backend application for managing data related to guilds, members, and activities within a gaming or community context. It aims to provide a structured way to store and retrieve information about users, their roles within guilds, and scheduled events like missions and raids.

## Problems Solved

- Centralized storage for game/community data.
- Facilitates the management of guild structures and member roles.
- Enables the scheduling and tracking of missions and raids.
- Provides a platform for integrating command-based interactions.

## How it Should Work

- Data should be accessible and modifiable through defined services and repositories.
- Commands should be processed by a command manager, interacting with services to perform actions.
- Events related to activities like raids should be handled to update data and trigger notifications or other processes.
- The application should be persistent, retaining data across sessions.

## User Experience Goals

- Provide a reliable and responsive backend for data management.
- Support clear and intuitive command interactions.
- Ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- Lay the groundwork for potential future integrations with frontend interfaces or external services.
