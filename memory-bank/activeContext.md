# Active Context: Kafra

## Current Work Focus

- Setting up and populating the Memory Bank documentation.

## Recent Changes

- Created all core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Read all core Memory Bank files to establish full context.
- Updated `systemPatterns.md` to clarify the role of `CommandManagerImpl`.

## Next Steps

- Await specific task from the user.

## Troubleshooting

- Encountered `UnsatisfiedDependencyException` due to missing `spring.ai.gemini_api_key` property. Added a placeholder value to `application.properties`.
- Encountered `IllegalArgumentException: Token may not be empty` due to empty `spring.jda.token` property. Added a placeholder value to `application.properties`.
- Maven build now completes successfully.
- Updated the `CommandManager` interface and `CommandManagerImpl` class to reflect the command management implementation.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensure all core Memory Bank files are present and contain relevant information.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Maintain clear and concise documentation in the Memory Bank.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project is a Java application using Spring Boot, based on the file structure.
- The project uses Maven (`pom.xml`, `mvnw`).
- Data persistence seems to be handled through repositories in the `data` package.
- Command handling is present in the `command` and `manager` packages.
- Event handling is present in the `event` and `service` packages.
